							<h1>Will Mc - Data Analyst</h1>
							<p>A skilled Data Cleaner, Inconsistency Spotter and Data Interrogator.</p>
						</header>
						<div class="image main"><img src="images/WillWork.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p><h2>Me:</h2>
							I am passionate about helping people - will discuss volunteering below - and can be found answering 
							fellow CareerFoundry students questions at all hours. <br>
							I want to help my employer too! If I see that 'somebody' needs to 
							... book in that product ... move those pallets ... clean that area ... I step in and just do it.<br>
							I also do a lot of forward thinking - aka Problem Spotting - Quickest and Easiest way to do a job?...
							where does <i>'that'</i> need to go afterwards?</p>
									
							<h2>Me and Data:</h2>
							I have been working with Excel for over 20 years (and approx the same for HTML). Collating data, comparing it,
							looking for duplicates (man, do I love a good old <i>'If-then-else'</i> statement)<br>
							Now, thanks to the CareerFoundry Data Analytics course, I love visualising data... as well as asking it so many more 
							questions!<br>
							I do have a preference for Python (Pandas) over SQL, but am happy to work with both. 
							(One of my jobs used <i>Lotus123</i> to manage their website. And if I can work around that... )
									
							<p><h2>Volunteering:</h2>
							I love to help. And I love to help people.<br>
							I have volunteered at charities and social clubs for over 17 years - from social clubs for people with Intellectual Disabilities 
							to Young Teenagers, to home visitations and helping at the Special Olympics in Ireland (2003).<br>
							I also plan to volunteer at the Special Olympics in Berlin in June 2023.
							<br></p>

							"<i>Will played a significant role during the initial growth of our company, and <b>during these years was responsible for 
							maintaining some of our most important databases</b>. I found him <b>well disposed to sifting through and organising large 
							quantities of data and extracting the most important details</b> with great efficiency and accuracy. Most of his work was 
							published live to our websites without the need for second proofing, as <b>his work was of an excellent standard</b>. 
							<br>Will is <b>very reliable, very conscientious, well able to think on his feet and take the initiative when necessary</b> - which was often! 
							Most of the time <b>when he encountered data problems, he presented them alongside well thought out solutions</b>, and only in the 
							most difficult situations was I required to contribute to solving the problems.</i>" <b>~ John Carton</b></div>

								collection and knows the profession very well. He has helped me in directing how to network and gave me tips daily on 
								how to improve my Python, Excel and SQL skills. Would 100% recommend adding Will to your team. <b>If you are looking for 
								someone to encourage, keep a team on task</b> and just generally being a friendly person to work with then 
								Will is your guy!</i>" <b>~ Matthew Ossachuk</b>

							"<i>I have felt William as a very helpful friend who has <b>always helped us in resolving issues related to different codes of SQL,
